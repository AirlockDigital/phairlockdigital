# Splunk Phantom App for Airlock Digital

This app provides investigative, containment and management actions for Airlock Digital's Application Allowlisting / Whitelisting software. It provides simple extensibility for the Airlock Digital REST API, allowing you to use Airlock Digital as part of your organisations SOAR workflow. 

Airlock Digital would like to thank Domenico Perre for his awesome contributions to this app! https://github.com/secops4thewin
